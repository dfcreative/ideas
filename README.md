# Ideas for projects

* _caret-toolkit_: get, set, getCoords, getBoundingBox, onchange, setFromCoords, charsInLine, lineNo
* _search by painting_: you paint a picture on the canvas, and google suggests similar images to what your looks like
* _spirals designer_: for mirca logo - define shape/function to repeat, folding, style etc. Switchable to regular rect coords.

## Neural networks

- should export simple formula
- should engage webgl in processing

* OSA-UCS formula
* Melodic frequencies profile classification
