# Ideas for projects

* [ ] _caret-toolkit_: get, set, getCoords, getBoundingBox, onchange, setFromCoords, charsInLine, lineNo
* [ ] _search by painting_: you paint a picture on the canvas, and google suggests similar images to what your looks like
* [x] [_spirals designer_](https://mircamtl.github.io/logo): for mirca logo - define shape/function to repeat, folding, style etc. Switchable to regular rect coords.
* [ ] _number shapes_, based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP-DZMmQBng). That is design approach to represent numbers, each prime is encoded by polygone and any number is a combination of them. 

## Neural networks

* [ ] OSA-UCS formula
* [ ] Melodic frequencies profile classification
* [ ] Learn what a photo looked like from the painting
* [ ] Learn to remove outlines from artistic pictures (toulouse-lautrec)
* [ ] Learn to reproduce instagram filters (how to do them manually?)
* [ ] Learn piano sound, through wavenet-like structure
* [ ] Neural mp3 decoder XD
* [ ] Learn classical DSP filters (just weighted samples)
