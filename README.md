# Ideas for projects

* [ ] _caret-toolkit_: get, set, getCoords, getBoundingBox, onchange, setFromCoords, charsInLine, lineNo
* [ ] _search by painting_: you paint a picture on the canvas, and google suggests similar images to what your looks like
* [x] [_spirals designer_](https://mircamtl.github.io/mirca-logo): for mirca logo - define shape/function to repeat, folding, style etc. Switchable to regular rect coords.

## Neural networks

- should export simple formula
- should engage webgl in processing

* [ ] OSA-UCS formula
* [ ] Melodic frequencies profile classification
