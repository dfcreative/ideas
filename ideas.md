# Ideas for projects

* [ ] _caret-toolkit_: get, set, getCoords, getBoundingBox, onchange, setFromCoords, charsInLine, lineNo
* [ ] _search by painting_: you paint a picture on the canvas, and google suggests similar images to what your looks like
* [x] [_spirals designer_](https://mircamtl.github.io/logo): for mirca logo - define shape/function to repeat, folding, style etc. Switchable to regular rect coords.
* [ ] _number shapes_, based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP-DZMmQBng). That is design approach to represent numbers, each prime is encoded by polygone and any number is a combination of them.
* [ ] _gl-line[2d]_, based on [this article](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/drawing-antialiased-lines/). Pass list of coords, it will draw lines for them.
* [ ] _fibonacci_process_, visualizing the way points move away from each other
* [ ] _webgl text rendering_ by the evanw’s thetamath method. Because there is no simple API like `draw(gl, string, opts)`.
* [ ] _pretty-float_ to format any number in human-readable decimal form, esp, for numbers like _0.0000000000001_ or _1.0000000000001e+32_, because `toFixed` sucks. Will be used in plot-grid at least.
* [ ] _svg-normalize_, bringing any svg to -1..1 or 0..1 form. Related - svg-getbbox.
* [ ] shape spectrogram - for detected frequencies build shapes, with reduced other spectral components

## Neural networks

* [ ] OSA-UCS formula
* [ ] Melodic frequencies profile classification
* [ ] Learn what a photo looked like from the painting
* [ ] Learn to remove outlines from artistic pictures (toulouse-lautrec)
* [ ] Learn to reproduce instagram filters (how to do them manually?)
* [ ] Learn piano sound, through wavenet-like structure
* [ ] Neural mp3 decoder XD
* [ ] Learn classical DSP filters (just weighted samples)
