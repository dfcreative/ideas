## Ways to improve emotional wealth

###  Cutting expenses
* Breaking up consuming/draining/expensive relationships
	* Shifting intersection times to the minimum, like day schedules
* Physically blocking ways of reaching the wasteful activities
	* Blocking out ways to things proviking emotionally expensive thoughts
* Developing allergic reaction to any sort of emotional drain
* Spending 30 days in isolation from the source of the turmoil, but not isolating yourself, isolating the source
* Switch context in case of feeling of anxiety, panic, loneliness, sadness or neediness
* Manipulativeness, assertiveness and judging - repeat mantra of reality does not owe you anything (see vk posting).
* Wishful thinking should get inversion and resolution via understanding that wish describes now as lack of golden goodie, but the whole is a golden goodie already
* Escapism? When you start reading twitter/fb/instagram feeds? Ideally rethink them as tools of promotion. Unfollow anything useless in there.
* When someone compares you with the other? Say good bye instantly and switch to better context. Do not believe or put any value into that - person has his picture of ideal world and you are not a part of it and never owe him to be that. Moreover by trying to fit, you contribute to his illusion of fake world.
* When someone compares you with real other in terms of benefit he/she gets from him? That is whether feeling offended by ignoring or trading manipulation. Anyways person is not polite with you and he/she does not consider you as a partner and by playing that you contribute to manipulations and the state of thoughts. Get out of such business and find real joy and commitment.
* Agressiveness or wish to prove something to someone when someone is not right? Unfairness? Accepting that, world does not owe you to be fair, and moving on.
* Arguing or when someone destroys your opinion or your beliefs, not explaining himself but just forcing himself? Like N. about killing animals? People may have opinions same as you. You have a right to disagree. Giving up your opinion in favor of the other is contributing to dictatorship and disbalance, that is leaving out part of the truth.
* When someone does not value you? Leave and forget. You do not owe him or her explanation.
* When someone is rude, not polite or not ...? He or she does not owe you a thing or fit into your mind model. Best you can is to notify that that makes others feel bad.
* When you feel envious that someone close got an aprartment, got faster than you, got benefit out of something? Feel sincerely glad for that person. But you are not together, that person is by himself/herself.
* When someone does not share thing with you, like feelings, where is he at, posessions etc.? That person does not owe you that. That is his or hers. But you are not together, you are a separate person for him.
* When someone cheats on you, spends time with other people not telling you or betrays you? That is his right to spend time whatever he/she likes, the person does not owe you a report, and reconsider your understanding of your value for that person. He or she does not appreciate you and best you can - not giving any attention to that person, otherwise you contribute to injustice and disbalance.
* When you feel revengious for ignoring you? That is normal, but a person did not owe you anything and the world is unfair. And also you can contribute to fairness and politeness by notifying people who you appreciate and who deserve that of your activity.
* When someone ignores questions from you? A person does not owe you a response, he can be busy, absent-minded, forgetful, lazy or discorganized. But understand that you are not important to him, ie you do not create any feelings or urge to respond.
* When you are disappointed and discouraged by person's preferences, views or likes (N. about bandit)? He does not owe you to fit into your set of values. But that means you at least got to know a person a bit better.
* When a person does not look into your eyes? He does not owe you that. Neither do you owe to look at anyone's eyes.
* Addiction to internet (melatonyne?), anticipation of a message/mail/info and getting frustrated from not getting that? Internet or people do not owe sending you messages, and you have overexaggerated image of your online interest. You are not interesting to anyone. Noone cares and noone gives a fuck about you. You did not do anything to be interesting to anyone. Emotionally you are broke. People are interested in you when you are not emotional broke, but consider that every direct message is expense - time, thoughts, emotions. So be glad you don't get excuses for wasting time, that is actually a care about you.
* Checking on time and imagining what is N. doing? If she wanted to let you know, she would. If she does not - you are not interesting to her, meaning she does not consider you as emotional asset to contribute, only to drain or take if you have something for her. Although that is your running routine of care or hobbie competition. That drains you out if she does not inform you - therefore you should not run that routine. If she wants care - she can ask you and appreciate that. That is the way you act. You do not owe you constant care for free. You start associating your time with her time. You can stop looking at watch by physical removing it from context.

* Askales rules
	* No promises, just unnoticeable surprize
	* You whether do or not, 2 categories
	* You do whether fear deposit by not doing or active deposit by doing
	* There is no right time for something, it is now
	* Responsibility == money, not work, not
	* No asks for permissions
	* No sugardaddy, but partner
	* Act without expectations
	* Be hard to yourself
	* No mess, make order
	* 2 types of discipline: to start, to continue

* If you want result - talk slow, smooth and calm, deep.

* Цель от и цель к: избавиться от ненавистной работы или найти любимую работу.

* Material surrounding is the result of realization, reflection and development of my business in life.

* My goal is defined by drive I am getting from the activity. If I don't - that is not my goal. Anything I want, as in childhood.

* Различай желание быть кем-то или работать где-то от настоящего кайфа от работы.

* Моя самооценка
	+ when Nata/sympathetic girl writes me
	+ when I do my best / everything planned during the day
	+ when I accomplish projects I get drive from and that are important
	+ unnoticeable
	+ when I am being flattened, being told how talented I am
	+ when I discover new ideas
	- when Nata/sympathetic girl does not write me
	- when I slack/not work a lot during the day
	- when I am being talkative
	- when I am being told I am weak, ugly etc
	- when I live for myself and not being needed
* Делай выбор исходя из кайфа, а не из самооценки

* Мотивация:
	+ драйв к достижению, радость от свершения, удовольствие от процесса
	- избегание достижения, отсутствие радости и веры в победу
	- слишком сложная цель вне зоны ближайшей видимости и возможности
	- отсутствие основания для достижения, что важнее самого достижения: знания, привычки, мотивация, люди
	- четкие шаги к достижению с привязкой по времени (туман войны с зоной видимости в 5 минут)

* Барьеры
	* внешние (people opinions, climate, audience, language)
	* внутренние

		* узость мышления (неспособность найти ответ на проблемный вопрос)
		* зона комфорта (здесь хорошо, я еще посижу, там - негативно)

* Связь с реальностью важнее планов. План - это украшение реальности и момента, дающее мотив. План - это замотивированный способ общения с реальностью, результат общения - новая реальность, в которой кайфово, ново и интересно жить. См. мобильную связь - она появилась
