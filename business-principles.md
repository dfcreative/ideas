In order to soft be well-sold, it should posess features listed below:

* Easy to use, as moment.js
	* Minimum external libs and deps needed. Ideally - one script.

	* ? Pkg systems
		* Bower

* Do not try to sell the thing. Try to demonstrate it's awesomeness in a way it deserves, which is likely awesome way. Selling should not be more than the value of thing itself.

If I see a small useful library which meet these criterias, in a neat, defect-free and clean sytem I’ll definitely use it and pay 5$ for it

Thought: care user attention, show just minimally needed things.
