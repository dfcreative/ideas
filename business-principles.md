# Business principles


In order to soft be well-sold, it should posess features listed below:

* Easy to use, as moment.js
	* Minimum external libs and deps needed. Ideally - one script.
	* Intuitive and well-documented API
	* Standard way of launching (intuitive)
* Multienvironmental (requirements to files)
	* ? Pkg systems
		* Bower
		* Component
		* Ender
		* Jam
		* Volo
		* Npm
		* Atmosphere (meteor)
		* Yeoman
		? Not sure. A target pkg solution fits better. Maximally - component, npm & bower.
	* ? Frameworks
		* Angular
		* Web-components
		* jquery
		* jquery-ui
		* zepto
		* bonzo
		* vanilla
		* mocha
		* Ember
		? Not sure. That means a lot of needless code. Better a one target system - vanilla, and an universal UMD-like adapter.
	* Code definition
		* UMD
		* ✘require-js
		* ✘AMD

	* smashingmagazine
	* css tuts
	* via google search

* Do not try to sell the thing. Try to demonstrate it's awesomeness in a way it deserves, which is likely awesome way. Selling should not be more than the value of thing itself.

If I see a small useful library which meet these criterias, in a neat, defect-free and clean sytem I’ll definitely use it and pay 5$ for it

Thought: care user attention, show just minimally needed things.
